# 4chan GhostPostMixer

Interleave deleted posts and ghost posts from the archives into live 4chan threads

## Why?

- Have you ever wondered what posts a jannie deleted in a thread?
- Have you ever written a reply only to find out you've been banned?
- Have you ever had a jannie delete every post you made after banning you?

This userscript can help you and the rest of the 4chan community in these situations.  The more people use it, the more useful it will become, because the power of the jannie to silence people will be reduced with every installation.

Installing this userscript is more effective than posting "FUCK JANNIES!"
